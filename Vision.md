# Proper Physical Education
## Introduction
Nowadays, many people are interested in being healthy and fit. However, not all of them
are ready to spend money on a personal trainer.
Although the training without proper technique may be dangerous. At best you won't
reach desired result, at worst you'll get injuries.
What if you had a smart helper that would correct your mistakes and coordinate the
training process?
## Our goal
Our project is a such helper. It will analyze your muscle activity and your posture. Based
on this data it will determine whether you are doing the exercises correctly or not and will
provide advice.
## Possible challenges
- Electromyography sensors need some improvements: we already have a wireless
version of the sensor, but it has power system issues
- It is hard to detect a human pose in a short time
## Growth points
To make our project more interactive we can use gamification
Technical details
We will use the scheme of wireless electromyography sensors developed during the
M.O.V.E. project from previous year. The plans include creating two more such sensors to
analyze the work of a muscle group. Then, we will write a program that will detect a
human pose and produce digital skeleton. After combining all components, the program
will analyze data and suggest corrections if needed.
